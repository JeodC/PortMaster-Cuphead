# PortMaster Wine - Cuphead
This isn't really a port, it's Cuphead running on wine64 and box64. It will boot and play on the Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini with a Rocknix distribution that has box64 and wine64 bundled. Such distributions (dev builds) can be found on the Rocknix Discord server.

## Installation
Copy the `cuphead` folder and `Cuphead.sh` file to the same place you would normally place your port files e.g. `/roms/ports`. Purchase and install the game with Steam or GOG on Windows (or download the Windows depot) and copy all of its data to `cuphead/data`. If you prefer to use a Linux version, you can bypass Wine64 and use only Box64--however you will need to set the `.sh` file for that up yourself.

If you want to set up the emulationstation decorations, copy `cover.png` to the `cuphead` folder and copy the contents of `gameinfo.xml` to your `gamelist.xml` file.

## DLC
Cuphead DLC requires Steam API, so it will not work unless emulation is used (not included).
